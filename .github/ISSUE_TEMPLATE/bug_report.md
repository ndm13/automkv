**When I do this:**
*describe your directory setup, `automkv.yml`, command, etc*

**I want this to happen:**
*describe the expected behavior*

**But instead this happens:**
*describe the actual behavior*

---
**Tips:**
If your issue is related to a specific `automkv.yml` file, please include a **minimal working example** of the file that reproduces the bug.

If your issue is related to a specific version of MKVToolNix (i.e. stops working after an update), please include the version information printed at the start of the program.
