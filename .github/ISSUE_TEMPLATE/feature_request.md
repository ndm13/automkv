**Currently:**
*describe the current behavior, or the effort it takes to work around a limitation*

**It would be really cool if:**
*describe the feature you want to be added*

**This might cause issues with:**
*describe any possible problems with implementing this feature, including changes to existing `automkv.yml` files*

---
**Tips:**
Generally speaking, automkv will only cover functionality within MKVToolNix's [`mkvpropedit`](https://mkvtoolnix.download/doc/mkvpropedit.html) tool, so *new features outside of this scope are unlikely (but not impossible) to be implemented.*  We also prioritize features that help with batch/bulk processing of MKV files.

Any shortcomings within the program logic, or in the processing of `automkv.yml` files, will also be considered.
